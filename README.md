# GOES-East-Big-Screen
A collection of web pages designed for real-time full screen viewing of GOES East imagery.

Originally created to be used with https://github.com/DeMille/url-cast-receiver on a Chromecast. but should work well on any big screen.

Thank you to [NOAA / NESDIS Center for Satellite Applications and Research](https://www.star.nesdis.noaa.gov/star/productdisclaimer.php) for making this possible!
All images come from the [GOES-East Image Viewer site](https://www.star.nesdis.noaa.gov/GOES/index.php).
